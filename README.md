# Activism Mail Bot

In light of recent events, I have created this Python script to send emails (using the template from [nomoreracistcops.github.io](https://nomoreracistcops.github.io/)) to a list of 159 elected US officials.

The script sends a **unique message to each lawmaker** by varying sentence structures and switching out nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives with synonyms.

**This script only works for gmail accounts.** 

tl;dr to use the script,  run `python3 send.py` in a terminal.

For a step-by-step walkthrough, see below. Please report bugs to alandgton@gmail.com!

NOTE: there is a per-minute limit on SMTP messages sent via google's servers. to appease our corporate overlords, i've decreased the speed of our operations.

TODO List:
- Setup Google OAuth2 so `activism-mail-bot` can use the gmail API instead of using SMTP.
- Accept JSON input from a front-end service to make `activism-mail-bot` more accessible. Checkout [la-mailer repo](https://github.com/michaelnyu/la-mailer).
